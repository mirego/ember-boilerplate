# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Since it is a boilerplate project, there are technically no official (versioned) _releases_. Therefore, the `master` branch should always be stable and usable.
